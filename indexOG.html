  <h3>The reason why I joined App Academy was that I was really interested in Computer Science, and even if I do not go into a CS Major or career, I see it playing a central role in my future. I am ambitious, always driven to learn. When I am passionate about a project I feel as though nothing can stop me. I remember two individual projects for App Academy where I was setting up websites. I was up until the bright hours of the morning working.</h3>
  <p>This was officially called "The API Project" back in Canvas during year two. What mine did, however, was specific to an eSport called Overwatch. The page displayed statistics such as rank, winrate, and most played hero. The site is also linked to third party information and news specific to the community. I actually enjoyed making this project so much that it is hosted and avaliable at the link below.</p>
  <p>M e m o r y L a n e, or more officially "The Band Project" was a big favorite of mine, because my band website was done solely for Vaporwave - a style so grand that it can occupy the space of being a meme and being a serious genre at the same time. My website for it was entirely in the Windows 95 AESTHETIC which I relish. I would like to link another project with it too. Additionally, I also enjoyed this project I, again, hosted it at the link below.</p>
